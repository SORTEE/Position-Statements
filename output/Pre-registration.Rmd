There is considerable pressure on scientists to rapidly produce innovative and significant results. Traditional publication practices favour statistically significant results (typically assessed using statistical measures, such as p-values). This is known as publication bias, and leads to multiple unwanted effects. First, researchers may not try as hard to publish non-significant results, exacerbating the problem [known as the file drawer effect; @rosenthal1979].

Here is an example citation: [@rosenthal1979].
